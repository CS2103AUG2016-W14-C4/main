## Introduction

TasKitty is an easy-to-use task manager designed specially for the average computer or laptop user who wants to keep track of their busy schedules. It is a Java desktop application that is perfect for keyboard lovers, as it implements a command-line interface in its GUI.

This guide describes the design and implementation of TasKitty. It will help you understand how TasKitty works and how you can further contribute to its development. We have organised this guide into the 4 major components that make up the core functionality of TasKitty, so that you can have an overview of how these essential components are linked before reading further into the parts that make up each component respectively.

## Setting up

### Prerequisites

1. **JDK `1.8.0_60`**  or later<br>

    > Having any Java 8 version is not enough. <br>
    This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
   
2. **Eclipse** IDE
3. **e(fx)clipse** plugin for Eclipse (Do the steps 2 onwards given in
   [this page](http://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html#for-the-ambitious))
4. **Buildship Gradle Integration** plugin from the Eclipse Marketplace


### Importing the project into Eclipse

0. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
1. Open Eclipse (Note: Ensure you have installed the **e(fx)clipse** and **buildship** plugins as given 
   in the prerequisites above)
2. Click `File` > `Import`
3. Click `Gradle` > `Gradle Project` > `Next` > `Next`
4. Click `Browse`, then locate the project's directory
5. Click `Finish`

  > * If you are asked whether to 'keep' or 'overwrite' config files, choose to 'keep'.
  > * Depending on your connection speed and server load, it can  take up to 30 minutes for the set up to finish
      (This is because Gradle downloads library files from servers during the project set up process).
  > * You can discard any changes that Eclipse may have auto-changed in any settings files during the import process.

## Design

### Architecture
<br></br>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/Architecture.png" width="800"><br>

<em>Fig. 1 Architecture Diagram</em>
</p>
<br></br>

The Figure 1 above, the _Architecture Diagram_, explains the high-level design of the task manager.
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has only one class called [`MainApp`](../src/main/java/seedu/taskitty/MainApp.java). It is responsible for
* initializing the components in the correct sequence, and connecting them with each other at app launch.
* shutting down the components and invoking the cleanup method where necessary at shut down.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level:
* `EventsCentre` : This class (written using [Google's Event Bus library](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained))
  is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design).
* `LogsCenter` : This class is used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.
* [**`UI`**](#ui-component) : Handles user interactions with the application.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component) : Parses and executes commands.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component) : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component) : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components
* defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the component.
* exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.
<br></br>

<p align="center">
<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

<em>Fig. 2 Logic Class Diagram</em>
</p>
<br></br>

For example, Figure 2 above shows the `Logic` component that defines its API in the `Logic.java`
interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.<br>
<br></br>

<em>Fig. 3 Sequence Diagram for Delete Task</em>
</p>
<br></br>

Figure 3 above, the _Sequence Diagram_, shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the
command `delete d1`.

>Note how the `Model` simply raises a `TaskManagerChangedEvent` when the TaskManager data are changed,
 instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.
<br></br>

<p align="center">
<img src="images\SDforDeleteTaskEventHandling.png" width="800"><br>

<em>Fig. 4 Sequence Diagram for Delete Task Event Handling</em>
</p>
<br></br>

Figure 4 above shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates
being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time. <br>

> Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having
  to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct 
  coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component
<br></br>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

<em>Fig. 5 UI Class Diagram</em>
</p>
<br></br>

**API** : [`Ui.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/taskitty/ui/Ui.java)<br>
Figure 5 shows the UI class diagram.<br>
The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TaskListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class
and they can be loaded using the `UiPartLoader`.<br>
The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layouts of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files
 that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.<br>
 For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](../src/main/java/seedu/taskitty/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in
 [`MainWindow.fxml`](../src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml).

The `UI` component:
* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

### Logic component

<em>Fig. 6 Logic Class Diagram</em>
</p>
<br></br>
<!-- @@author A0139052L -->

**API** : [`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/taskitty/logic/Logic.java)<br>
Figure 6 shows the Logic class diagram.<br>
`Logic` uses the `CommandParser` class to parse the user command.<br>
This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.<br>
The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task) or `Storage` (e.g. set new save file path) and/or raise events.<br>
The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Figure 7 above shows the general Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component and with the `Model` for general commands such as `execute("delete d1")` API call shown.<br>
> Note that commands that affects the `TaskManager` inside of `Model` will store the command information after successful execution (before execution for `ClearCommand`) , while other commands does not need to store any command information (e.g `ViewCommand`).<br>

### Model component
<br></br>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

<em>Fig. 10 Model Class Diagram</em>
</p>
<br></br>

**API** : [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/taskitty/model/Model.java)<br>
Figure 10 above shows the Model class diagram.<br>
The `Model`component:
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Task Manager data.
* stores previous executed command information necessary for undo/redo function in a `CommandHistoryManager` class.
* exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyTask>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list
  so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

<em>Fig. 11 Storage Class Diagram</em>
</p>
<br></br>

**API** : [`Storage.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/taskitty/storage/Storage.java)<br>
Figure 11 above shows the Storage class diagram.<br>
The `Storage` component:
* saves `UserPrefs` objects in json format and reads it back.
* saves the Task Manager data in xml format and reads it back.

<!-- @@author -->
### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.taskitty.commons` package.

## Implementation

### Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file 
(default: `config.json`).

### Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels
and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file
  (See [Configuration](#configuration)).
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to
  the specified logging level.
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

**Logging Levels**

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that are not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging
  e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

## Testing

Tests can be found in the `./src/test/java` folder.

**In Eclipse**:
> If you are not using a recent Eclipse version (i.e. _Neon_ or later), enable assertions in JUnit tests
  as described [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2522897/eclipse-junit-ea-vm-option).

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose
  `Run as` > `JUnit Test`.
* To run a subset of tests, right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose
  to run as a JUnit test.

**Using Gradle**:
* See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) for how to run tests using Gradle.

We have two types of tests:

1. **GUI Tests** - These are _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. 
   These are in the `guitests` package.
  
2. **Non-GUI Tests** - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
   * _Unit tests_ that target the lowest level methods/classes. <br>
      e.g. `seedu.taskitty.commons.UrlUtilTest`
   * _Integration tests_ that check the integration of multiple code units 
     (those code units are assumed to be working).<br>
      e.g. `seedu.taskitty.storage.StorageManagerTest`
   * _Hybrids of unit and integration tests_ that check multiple code units as well as 
      how the are connected together.<br>
      e.g. `seedu.taskitty.logic.LogicManagerTest`
  
**Headless GUI Testing** :
Thanks to the [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) library we use,
 our GUI tests can be run in the headless mode. 
 In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen.
 That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.<br><br>
 See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md#running-tests) to learn how to run tests in headless mode.
  
## Dev Ops

### Build Automation

See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

### Continuous Integration

We use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects.
See [UsingTravis.md](UsingTravis.md) for more details.

### Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release:
 
 1. Generate a JAR file [using Gradle](UsingGradle.md#creating-the-jar-file).
 2. Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`.
 3. [Create a new release using GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) 
    and upload the JAR file your created.
   
### Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Task Manager depends on the
[Jackson library](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome) for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_
can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which
is better than <br>
* including those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)<br>
* requiring developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)<br>

#### Rachel: `Todo.txt`

**Pros**

* Has many filters to choose from: project, context, priority, keyword, etc, so it is easy to narrow down a long list based on what you want to look for.

* Can be used on a command line interface e.g. terminal.
* Can be used on virtually any platform and edited using any text editor.
* Can save the list as a file in its original, human-readable format, so that even when the application is deleted or uninstalled, the file left behind retains the same readable format when opened by a text editor.

* Has a simple and minimalistic interface.

**Cons**

* Has no support for subtasks under main tasks.
* Has no undo function.
