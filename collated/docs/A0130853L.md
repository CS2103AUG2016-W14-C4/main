## Introduction

TasKitty is an easy-to-use task manager designed specially for the average computer or laptop user who wants to keep track of their busy schedules. It is a Java desktop application that is perfect for keyboard lovers, as it implements a command-line interface in its GUI.

This guide describes the design and implementation of TasKitty. It will help you understand how TasKitty works and how you can further contribute to its development. We have organised this guide into the 4 major components that make up the core functionality of TasKitty, so that you can have an overview of how these essential components are linked before reading further into the parts that make up each component respectively.

### UI component
<br></br>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

<em>Fig. 5 UI Class Diagram</em>
</p>
<br></br>

**API** : [`Ui.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/taskitty/ui/Ui.java)<br>
Figure 5 shows the UI class diagram.<br>
The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TaskListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class
and they can be loaded using the `UiPartLoader`.<br>
The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layouts of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files
 that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.<br>
 For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](../src/main/java/seedu/taskitty/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in
 [`MainWindow.fxml`](../src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml).

The `UI` component:
* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

#### Rachel: `Todo.txt`

**Pros**

* Has many filters to choose from: project, context, priority, keyword, etc, so it is easy to narrow down a long list based on what you want to look for.
* Can sync with Dropbox automatically and quickly, so the user can conveniently access the list at any place that has an internet connection.
* Can be used on a command line interface e.g. terminal.
* Can be used on virtually any platform and edited using any text editor.
* Can save the list as a file in its original, human-readable format, so that even when the application is deleted or uninstalled, the file left behind retains the same readable format when opened by a text editor.
* Can sort tasks based on 5 priority labels (alphabets A - E, where A corresponds to the highest priority), with non-prioritised tasks listed at the bottom.
* Has a simple and minimalistic interface.

**Cons**

* Has no support for editing of directory in the application, so user has to manually edit one of the downloaded files â€œtodo.cfgâ€? in order to specify the directory in which the user wishes the save the file when used on a desktop.
* Has no support for routine tasks.
* Has no support for subtasks under main tasks.
* Has no undo function.
