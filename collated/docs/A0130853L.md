#### Rachel: `Todo.txt`

**Pros**

* Has many filters to choose from: project, context, priority, keyword, etc, so it is easy to narrow down a long list based on what you want to look for.
* Can sync with Dropbox automatically and quickly, so the user can conveniently access the list at any place that has an internet connection.
* Can be used on a command line interface e.g. terminal.
* Can be used on virtually any platform and edited using any text editor.
* Can save the list as a file in its original, human-readable format, so that even when the application is deleted or uninstalled, the file left behind retains the same readable format when opened by a text editor.
* Can sort tasks based on 5 priority labels (alphabets A - E, where A corresponds to the highest priority), with non-prioritised tasks listed at the bottom.
* Has a simple and minimalistic interface.

**Cons**

* Has no support for editing of directory in the application, so user has to manually edit one of the downloaded files “todo.cfg” in order to specify the directory in which the user wishes the save the file when used on a desktop.
* Has no support for routine tasks.
* Has no support for subtasks under main tasks.
* Has no undo function.
