#### Jia Wern: `iCal`

**Pros**

* Can add events very easily by clicking in the corresponding timeslot.
* Can change duration of events easily by dragging the borders of the event.
* Has flexibility in terms of being able to set a task to be a recurring task, setting an event to be an entire day and even setting alarms/reminders for the event.
* Can categorize events and each category is distinctly colour coded.
* Works across all platforms (desktop, tablet, phone).
* Can search for events.
* Can undo their previous action.

**Cons**

* Requires users to fill details individually into the respective categories. There is no option to type everything in one line and the relevant sections will be filled up automatically.
* Has no way to mark an item as done.
* Has no automatic way to block of timings. An actual event has to be created and deleted should the event is not happening anymore.

#### Edit task details: `edit`
Edits a todo, deadline or event already inside the task manager using the index of the task.<br>
* Format: `edit INDEX [NEW_NAME] [NEW_DATE] [NEW_START_TIME] [NEW_END_TIME]`

> Edits a task at the specified `INDEX` under the todos `t`, deadlines `d` or events `e` section. The `INDEX` refers to the category and index number shown in the most recent listing. eg. `t1` `d2` `e3` <br>
If no or an invalid category was listed, the app will default to todo format `t`. eg. `1` and `+1` becomes `t1` <br><br>
> Format depends on the type of task being edited. When only 1 `TIME` is provided, it is treated as `END_TIME` for both deadline and event.<br><br>
> Note that you can enter the `view` command before the `edit` command, to view the list of tasks and events and edit the specified task accordingly. Alternatively, you can use the [`find`](#find-tasks-find) command to narrow down the displayed list of tasks and events.

#### Save/Load data: `path`
Saves data to a specified folder.<br>
Format: `path FILEPATH.`

* Windows OS FILEPATH format example: `C:\\Users\\<username>\\Desktop\\CS2103 Tutorial\\TasKitty.xml`
* Mac OS FILEPATH format example: `/Users/<username>/Desktop/CS2103 Tutorial/TasKitty.xml`

TasKitty must end with a .xml extension.<br>
TasKitty will save any other FILEPATH format in the same directory as TasKitty.<br>
TasKitty will automatically create the folder if the folder is not present.<br>
TasKitty can load data from an existing .xml file if TasKitty is empty.<br>

Example:
* `path /Users/<username>/Desktop/CS2103 Tutorial/TasKitty.xml`<br>
  Saves TasKitty data into the folder CS2103 Tutorial with TasKitty.xml as the filename.<br>
  If folder CS2103 Tutorial is not present, TasKitty will create the folder.
