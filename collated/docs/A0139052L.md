**API** : [`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/taskitty/logic/Logic.java)<br>
Figure 6 shows the Logic class diagram.<br>
`Logic` uses the `CommandParser` class to parse the user command.<br>
This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.<br>
The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task) or `Storage` (e.g. set new save file path) and/or raise events.<br>
The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Figure 7 above shows the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component and with the Model for the `execute("delete d1")` API call.<br>
> Note that commands that affects the `TaskManager` inside of `Model` will store the command information after successful execution (before execution for ClearCommand) , while other commands does not need to store any command information.<br>

Figure 7 above shows the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component, where the Command directly posts an Event to the `EventsCenter` for the `execute("help")` API call.<br>

#### Redo previous undone action: `redo`
Redoes the last undoned action.<br>
Format: `redo`<br>
Shortcut key: `Ctrl + Shift + Y`

The previous undone version will be restored.<br>
User can keep redoing multiple undone actions until we reach the latest version.<br>

Example:

* `redo`<br>
  Redoes the last deleted item.<br>
  
  Before:<br>
  <img src="images/UIundoAfter.png" width="900"><br>
  
  After:<br>
  <img src="images/UIredoAfter.png" width="900"><br>

<br>

> Note that for undo and redo, you are only able to undo/redo commands that changes the task manager. eg. add, delete
Commands that do not affect the task manager cannot be undone/redone. eg. view, help <br>

>If you have undone actions and you enter a new valid command that is undoable, previous undone actions that were not redone will be lost.<br>

>Note that undoing/redoing does not change the view status back to the one before undoing/redoing, it will stay at the current status until you enter a different command that changes the view status.
