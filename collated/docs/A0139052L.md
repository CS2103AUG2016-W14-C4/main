**API** : [`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/taskitty/logic/Logic.java)<br>
Figure 6 shows the Logic class diagram.<br>
`Logic` uses the `CommandParser` class to parse the user command.<br>
This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.<br>
The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task) or `Storage` (e.g. set new save file path) and/or raise events.<br>
The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

<br></br>

Figure 7 above shows the general Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component and with the `Model` for general commands such as `execute("delete d1")` API call shown.<br>
> Note that commands that affects the `TaskManager` inside of `Model` will store the command information after successful execution (before execution for `ClearCommand`) , while other commands does not need to store any command information (e.g `ViewCommand`).<br>
